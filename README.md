### Object
Create a UI component similar to jQuery Autocomplete

### Direction

Write an auto-complete component using HTML5/CSS3 without a javascript framework (jQuery, Underscore, etc.).

Given the array of possible values such as [‘apple’, ‘orange’, ‘banana’], typing ‘ap’ into the auto-complete component should show ‘apple’ as a possible value. Typing ‘an’ should show ‘orange’ and ‘banana’ as options.
